# Tiger Compiler Labs in C++

## Overview

We rewrote the Tiger Compiler labs using the C++ programming language because some features in C++ like inheritance and polymorphism
are more suitable for these labs and less error-prone.

We provide you all the codes of all labs at one time. In each lab, you only
need to code in some of the directories.

## Difference Between C Labs and C++ Labs 

1. Tiger compiler in C++ uses [flexc++](https://fbb-git.gitlab.io/flexcpp/manual/flexc++.html) and [bisonc++](https://fbb-git.gitlab.io/bisoncpp/manual/bisonc++.html) instead of flex and bison because flexc++ and bisonc++ is more flexc++ and bisonc++ are able to generate pure C++ codes instead of C codes wrapped in C++ files.

2. Tiger compiler in C++ uses namespace for modularization and uses inheritance and polymorphism to replace unions used in the old labs.

3. Tiger compiler in C++ uses CMake instead of Makefile to compile and build the target.


## Installing Dependencies

We provide you a Docker image that has already installed all the dependencies. You can compile your codes directly in this Docker image.

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/).

2. Run a docker container and mount the lab directory on it.

```bash
# Run this command in the root directory of the project
docker run -it --privileged -p 2222:22 -v $(pwd):/home/stu/tiger-compiler yuexizou/tiger-compiler-env:tiger  # or make docker-run
```

## Compiling and Debugging

There are five makeable targets in total, including `test_slp`, `test_lex`, `test_parse`, `test_semant`,  and `tiger-compiler`.

1. Run container environment and attach to it

```bash
# Run container and directly attach to it
docker run -it --privileged -p 2222:22 \
    -v $(pwd):/home/stu/tiger-compiler yuexizou/tiger-compiler-env:tiger  # or `make docker-run`
# Or run container in the backend and attach to it later
docker run -dt --privileged -p 2222:22 \
    -v $(pwd):/home/stu/tiger-compiler yuexizou/tiger-compiler-env:tiger
docker attach ${YOUR_CONTAINER_ID}
```

2. Build in the container environment

```bash
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make test_xxx  # or `make build`
```

3. Debug using gdb or any IDEs

```bash
gdb test_xxx # e.g. `gdb test_slp`
```

**Note: we will use `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` to grade your labs, so make
sure your lab passed the released version**

## Testing Your Labs

Use `make`
```bash
make gradelabx
```


You can test all the labs by
```bash
make gradeall
```


## Other Commands

Utility commands can be found in the `Makefile`. They can be directly run by `make xxx` in a Unix shell. Windows users cannot use the `make` command, but the contents of `Makefile` can still be used as a reference for the available commands.
